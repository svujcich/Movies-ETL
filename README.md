# Overview
Using the ETL process, this project uses an automated pipeline that was created to take in new data, perform transformations, and load the data into existing tables in an SQL database. This project uses Jupyter notebook to clean, merge, and upload cleaned movie data to an SQL server. Three raw data files were provided: a Wikipedia data file, a Kaggle Metadata file and a MovieLens rating data. Due to size constraints of github, original files were not uploaded to repository. 
 
### Technology used
   - Jupyter Notebook 
   - pgAdmin (as SQL server)

**Note that due to size constraints of github, original files were not uploaded to repository.
